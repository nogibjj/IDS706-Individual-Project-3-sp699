# IDS-706-Data-Engineering :computer:

## Individual Project 2 :page_facing_up:

## :ballot_box_with_check: Requirements
* __`Databricks ETL Pipeline`__: A well-documented Databricks notebook that performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, checked into the repository.
* __`Usage of Delta Lake`__: Your ETL pipeline correctly utilizes Delta Lake for data storage.
* __`Usage of Spark SQL`__: Your pipeline effectively utilizes Spark SQL for data transformations.
* __`Visualization and Conclusion`__: Implement thorough error handling and data validation, and create a visualization of the transformed data.
* __`README.md`__: The README.md file is clear, concise, and guides the user on how to run the program and includes the conclusion and recommendation.
* __`Automated Trigger`__: Include an automated trigger to initiate the pipeline, demonstrated in the video.
* __`Video Demo`__: A YouTube link in README.md showing a clear, concise walkthrough and demonstration of Databricks ETL pipeline.

## :ballot_box_with_check: To-do List
* __ETL Operation__: Create a Databricks Notebook to extract, transform, and load the data.
* __Delta Lake__: Learn the principles of Delta Lake and utilize it for storing the transformed data.
* __Spark SQL__: Utilize Spark SQL to cleanse and prepare the big data.
* __Visulization__: "Create a plot of the transformed data.
* __Automated Trigger__: Incorporates a trigger to initiate the pipeline automatically.
